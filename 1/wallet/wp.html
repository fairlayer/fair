WeOS is represented by carbon based lifeforms that have access to devices such as phones, tablets, laptops, desktop workstations and even smart watch.

10 amendments:

1. Every citizen has a right to run a full node. Every mid-range consumer device must be able to download entire blockchain in adequate time and no delays

In the beginning WeOS must be truly __gentle__ until we build our own tailored hardware, otherwise no one will run it on their devices.

* 1% of storage
* 1% of bandwidth
* 1% of RAM

Even on low-end devices. Let's take the following values from my default configuration 2013 Macbook Pro:

* 1% of 256 GB is ~ 3Gb for state size.
* 4 Gb
* 100 Mb of RAM

Sure we can require users to buy something like https://www.apple.com/imac-pro/specs/ with 18 cores, 32 Gb of RAM and 4 TB, and just write whatever we want because anything will be fast and there will be enough space for anything on a device like that, but that means zero adoption.

Now almost nobody runs a full node on their desktop, basically giving up trust back to custodians somewhere in the cloud. This diminishes the very idea of a blockchain and trustless platforms.

That's why it's a MUST for every citizen of We to have at least one __full node__ having onchain layer 1 running in it.

We need something that gently downloads, is very mild on resources, and the user must never see a __ridiculous never ending sync screen__ they get in Mist of Bitcoin Qt

Which brings us to snapshots.

__Becoming a node__ must be as hard as downloading the Matrix from torrents (700Mb).

Remark: I'm actually in a 4 star hotel in Berlin at the time of writing this, and downloading the 700 Mb Matrix takes me over an hour, so it's not about money or social status, it's about the fact that the connection actually sucks on average, even in developed countries thanks to crony capitalism.

Those 700 Mb must include the node software, the snapshot and the blockchain since the snapshot.

Simple thought experiment: even at 1Kb per block, would grow at 5 mb per month, yet




There are 4 types of users:

archiving node: stores all transactions from day one


2. Voting

3. Figuring out metrics of our new government


Figure out when people are dying onchain. Then calculate the average. Set goals for president, if average is too low, auto-revoting.





You are an average blockchain user. You use it rarely, but you're enthusiastic but not that enthusiastic to buy an extra hardware or pay for a dedicated fiber just to stay in sync with the chain.

How many Mb the blockchain adds per every week you wasn't actively syncing, and how long it takes to sync it on World Average Speed https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-first-quarter-2017-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-report.jsp (7Mpbs - About one megabyte per second download )?
